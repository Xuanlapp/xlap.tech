# Offorest Product Data Model

This document is the current database source of truth for Offorest.

## Current tables

Offorest keeps the product workflow intentionally small:

```text
users
products
product_user
vertex_api_credentials
prompts
product_design_assets
psd_mockup_templates
activity_logs
```

Laravel system tables such as `sessions`, `jobs`, `failed_jobs`, `cache`, and `migrations` remain framework-owned tables.

## users

The base Laravel user table also stores Offorest account flags.

- `is_admin`: allows access to admin pages such as `/offorest/admin/users`.

## products

Stores the product/page list shown in the app navigation.

- `id`: primary key.
- `name`: display name, for example Redesign or Mockup.
- `slug`: stable unique key used by routes and permissions.
- `description`: optional admin/help description.
- `is_active`: controls whether the product can be shown/used.
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: timestamps.

Seeded products: `redesign`, `mockup`, `sticker`, `ornament`, `poster`.

## product_user

Pivot table for product access. A user can access many products, and a product can be assigned to many users.

- `id`: primary key.
- `user_id`: user receiving access.
- `product_id`: product being assigned.
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: timestamps.

The table has a unique key on `user_id + product_id`.

## vertex_api_credentials

Stores one Vertex API credential per user.

- `id`: primary key.
- `user_id`: owner. This is unique, so one user has one credential.
- `project_id`: Google Cloud project ID.
- `location`: Vertex AI location, for example `global`.
- `client_email`: service account email.
- `private_key`: encrypted private key.
- `credentials_json`: encrypted full service account JSON.
- `is_active`: whether this credential should be used.
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: timestamps.

## prompts

Stores per-user, per-product prompt slots. Each product page can have prompt buttons 1, 2, 3, 4 without hardcoding columns.

- `id`: primary key.
- `user_id`: owner.
- `product_id`: product/page this prompt belongs to.
- `prompt_number`: prompt slot number, usually 1-4.
- `name`: optional prompt label.
- `content`: full prompt text.
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: timestamps.

The table has a unique key on `user_id + product_id + prompt_number`.

Prompt UI rules:

- Prompt management opens from the product page with the shared `openModal` event.
- Current modal: `App\Livewire\Modals\Prompt\DetailPrompt`.
- Current view: `resources/views/livewire/modals/prompt/detail-prompt.blade.php`.
- The modal receives `productSlug`, then loads only prompts owned by the current authenticated user for that product.
- A product page can have at most 4 prompts.
- Show the add `+` button only while the user has fewer than 4 prompts for that product.
- Existing prompts can be edited and saved.
- Prompts cannot be deleted from the UI.
- Default prompt names by slot are: `Design`, `Mockup1`, `Mockup2`, `Mockup3`.

Open modal example:

```blade
wire:click="$dispatch('openModal', { component: 'modals.prompt.detail-prompt', arguments: { productSlug: 'sticker' } })"
```

Save flow:

```text
DetailPrompt modal
 ↓
PromptService
 ↓
PromptRepository
 ↓
prompts table
 ↓
toast success/error
```

## product_design_assets

Stores product row data: keyword, source image link, redesign output, and mockup output links.

- `id`: primary key.
- `user_id`: owner.
- `product_id`: product/page this row belongs to.
- `item_number`: per-user, per-product display number. It starts at 1 for each `user_id + product_id` group and increases automatically when a new row is created.
- `keyword`: keyword from sheet/import/manual entry.
- `image_link`: source image link, stored as `VARCHAR(1000)` because source URLs can be long.
- `redesign`: redesign output link/text.
- `lifestyle1`, `lifestyle2`, `lifestyle3`: Lifestyle Image outputs stored separately from custom PSD mockups.
- `mockup1` through `mockup11`: mockup output links/text.
- `is_approved`: marks items accepted by the user after at least one mockup exists.
- `approved_at`: timestamp for the latest approval action.
- `drive_uploaded_at`: timestamp for the latest successful approved-image export to Google Drive.
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: timestamps.

For the Sticker page workflow:

- `image_link`: source image shown in column 1.
- `redesign`: image generated from `image_link` and prompt number 1, shown in column 2.
- Sticker UI does not use the Lifestyle Image step.
- `mockup1` through `mockup11`: custom PSD mockup slots for column 3. New outputs append to the first empty slot, so the image created first is stored first.

For custom PSD mockups:

- Full renderer and UI documentation: `docs/sticker-psd-mockup.md`.
- The user uploads PSD templates through `App\Livewire\Modals\Sticker\PsdMockupTemplate`.
- A user can store many PSD files, but only one PSD can be active for one function.
- Sticker custom PSD uses `function_key = sticker_custom_mockup`.
- `Generate PSD` uses the active PSD template, the master image from `redesign`, and replaces the PSD layer named `Design`.
- PSD folders named `MOCKUP 1`, `MOCKUP 2`, ... are rendered as PNG outputs by `scripts/psd-renderer/render.js`.
- Rendered PNG outputs append to the first empty `mockup1` through `mockup11` slot. Do not reserve `mockup1` for Lifestyle.
- Approval is allowed only after at least one `mockup1` through `mockup11` value exists.
- Approval is also allowed when at least one `lifestyle1`, `lifestyle2`, or `lifestyle3` value exists.
- Approved items must be unapproved before editing source details.
- Sticker list filters: `all`, `unapproved` (not approved, including items with or without `redesign`), and `approved`.
- Current renderer supports PNG export only. GIF/sheet update can be added later as a separate step.

The Ornament page mirrors the Sticker workflow with its own product slug, Livewire components, prompts, PSD templates, and generated output folders under `generated/ornament/...`.

Approved local images can be exported to Google Drive by schedule or admin action:

- Command: `php artisan offorest:upload-approved-images-to-drive`.
- Schedule: daily at `22:00`, defined in `routes/console.php`.
- Manual trigger: Admin page button `Upload images to Drive`.
- Only local `/storage/...` URLs are uploaded. After upload, the database column is replaced with the Google Drive URL and the local file is deleted.

## activity_logs

Stores audit trail entries for user, admin, and automated system actions.

- `user_id`: actor user when available, nullable for system jobs.
- `actor_type`: `user`, `admin`, or `system`.
- `event`: machine-readable event key, for example `drive_export.image_uploaded`.
- `description`: human-readable summary.
- `subject_type`, `subject_id`: optional affected model.
- `properties`: JSON detail payload for later processing/reporting.
- `ip_address`, `user_agent`: request metadata when available.
- `occurred_at`: event time.

Admin page: `/offorest/admin/logs`.

## psd_mockup_templates

Stores user-uploaded PSD files for custom mockup rendering.

- `id`: primary key.
- `user_id`: owner.
- `product_id`: product/page this PSD belongs to.
- `function_key`: feature key, for example `sticker_custom_mockup`.
- `name`: user-facing PSD name.
- `original_filename`: uploaded filename.
- `storage_path`: path on the public storage disk.
- `is_active`: selected PSD for this user/product/function.
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: timestamps.

Selection rule:

```text
User can have many PSD templates.
User + Product + function_key can have only one active PSD at a time.
Uploading a new PSD for the same function automatically deactivates older PSD files.
```

Render flow:

```text
ProductDesignCard::generatePsdMockups
StickerService
PsdMockupTemplateService active template
PsdMockupRenderer
Node ag-psd renderer
ProductDesignAssetRepository append mockup1..mockup11
toast success/error
```

Sticker data entry uses progressive disclosure:

1. The user enters `keyword` inline on the list page.
2. After submitting the keyword, the page opens the `image_link` input.
3. After saving `image_link`, the source image is shown and the generation controls unlock.

Current Sticker UI is split into a parent page and child card components:

- `App\Livewire\Pages\Sticker\ListSticker`: parent page. It loads the list and mounts each card with a stable Livewire key.
- `App\Livewire\Pages\Sticker\ProductDesignCard`: one card/item. It owns per-item actions such as generate master and generate final images.
- `App\Livewire\Modals\Sticker\AddProductDesign`: add item modal.
- `App\Livewire\Modals\Sticker\EditProductDetail`: edit item modal.

Sticker list pagination:

- `ListSticker` uses Livewire `WithPagination`.
- Available page sizes are `5`, `10`, `20`, `50`, `100`, `200`, `400`.
- The chosen page size is stored with `#[Session(key: 'sticker.per-page')]`.
- Changing page size resets the user to page 1.
- `StickerService::paginatedAssetsForUser()` calls `ProductDesignAssetRepository::paginateForUserAndProduct()`, so the database only loads the current page.
- Each visible row is still mounted as `ProductDesignCard` with key `sticker-product-design-card-{id}`.

Add/edit flow:

```text
Add item:
Add modal -> StickerService -> ProductDesignAssetRepository -> DB
          -> dispatch product-design-created
          -> ListSticker refreshes list and appends the new card
          -> dispatch toast success

Edit item:
Edit modal -> StickerService -> DB
           -> dispatch sticker-product-design-updated with assetId
           -> only matching ProductDesignCard refreshes itself
           -> dispatch toast success
```

This structure is intentional. Do not put all item logic back into `ListSticker`, because that causes the whole page to re-render and can reset unfinished work in other cards.

Image preview supports direct image/CDN URLs and normalizes common shared links such as Google Drive and Dropbox before rendering. The browser loads images through a signed `/image-preview` route, so providers that block normal hotlinking are handled more consistently. If the source URL is a product page instead of an actual image, or the provider blocks server-side fetching, the UI shows a fallback link that opens the original URL.

`id` remains the database primary key and is unique across every user. `item_number` is the visible STT for the user, so different users can both have item number 1 without conflict.
